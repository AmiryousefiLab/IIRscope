You need to provide information related to at least two species for the analysis to proceed. After you have successfully provided your input files, press the *Submit* button. This will activate its following box. Be patient until you are communicated through that box and the progress bar on how to proceed for downloading your output. Also note that the computations may take up to five minutes. Please be patient. For running the analysis, one can use either of the following cases:

1. **GB Files**: In this method, you can provide the GB files or the accession number of the related species to obtain the IR plot. This function is active under the *GB File* tab.

2. **Manual Files**: This method is useful for the times when simple tabular format of the annotations, the genome sequences of the targeted species, and possibly their corresponding inverted repeat regions boundary coordinates are available. This function is active under *Manual Files* tab.

Further instructions for each case is given specifically under relevant tab.
