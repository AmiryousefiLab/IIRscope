In case your GB files are of low quality or otherwise not available and still you would like to obtain the plot, you can provide your annotations as a simple tabular format [DOGMA](https://dogma.ccbb.utexas.edu) beside their genomes in fasta format and proceed to obtain the plot. In case you also have the values for the junction sites coordinates, you can provide them on the *IR info* section as JLB, JSB, JSA, and JLA respectively. This decreases the processing time dramatically and would be useful in cases where for example the IR regions are not identical.
