#### Welcome to *IRscope+* . . .

**IRscope+** is the updated version of the [IRscope](http://irscope.shinyapps.io/irapp/) which allows more control on the plotting options, provide a lower calculation time and improved performance with regard to detection of the genes and underlying regions. Similar to its ancestor,  IRscope+, allows the the input files using the *Files upload* tab. After the submission, the program will start searching the **Inverted Repeat** regions. The interactive timing bar provides insight into the calculation task and variety the output and the real-time interactive colouring theme can be easily used to produce your desired output. Note that the species selected will lead to the detection of a consensus radius for each junction site for the genes to be plotted. This indicates that if the input files are not representing closely related species, the program may lead to unsatisfactory result. The program will warn you when this happens so you may decrease the evolutionary distance of your underlying input species. Finally note that the input files can be either manual annotations, accession numbers from [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/), or related GB files of the chloroplast genomes.
