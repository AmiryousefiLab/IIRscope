#### Welcome to *IIRscope* . . .

**IIRscope** is a tool for  visualizing the genes on the boundaries of the junction sites of the chloroplast genome. The input files can be uploaded using the *Files upload* tab. After the submission, the program will start searching the **Inverted Repeat** regions. Note that the species selected will lead to a consensus radius for each junction site for the genes to be plotted. This indicates that if the input files are not representing closely related species, the program may lead to unsatisfactory result. The program will warn you when this happens. Finally note that the input files can be either manual annotations, accession numbers from [GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/), or related GB files of the chloroplast genomes.
